# HirePerHour
HirePerHour connects customers with local service professionals (plumbers, cleaners, electricians) for instant hourly bookings. Like Uber for handymen, it offers transparent pricing, verified providers, and real-time trackingâ€”no long-term contracts, just fast, reliable service when you need it.
